# The Prevalence of Sports Science and Sports Medicine Meta-Analyses that Confuse Standard Error with Standard Deviation in Effect Size Calculations
Meta-analyses are often highly cited and can influence policy and inform practice. With the availability of off-the-shelf software for performing meta-analyses, many researchers are conducting their own meta-analyses, without input from someone with expertise in research design and statistics. This may lead to errors. A recent review identified a high prevalence of errors in meta-analyses in strength and conditioning research, including a simple error that can drastically affect results: the use of standard error rather than standard deviation when calculating standardized effect sizes. Standard error values are typically smaller than the standard deviation, resulting in overestimation of effect sizes—sometimes by large amounts—which can lead to mistakes in the overall conclusion of the meta-analysis. We sought to estimate the prevalence of this specific error in highly ranked sports science and sports medicine journals.
